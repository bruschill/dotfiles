<h1 class="underlined">About</h1>

<p>
  <b><big><big>TaskRPG</big></big></b> is an experience-based task tracker where you're rewarded for getting out of the house and, you know, <em>doing things</em>.
</p><br />

<p>
  <big>Basically</big>, it works like this:
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  <li class="indented">Sign in</li>
  <li class="indented">Make a list</li>
  <li class="indented">Add some tasks and set their experience value</li>
  <li class="indented">Complete said tasks</li>
  <li class="indented">Gain experience and level up</li>
  <li class="indented">Repeat 2 through 5 as needed</li>
  <li class="indented">Become the most productive human being on Earth!</li>
</ul>

<p>
  It really is that simple!
</p><br />

<p>
  So listen, when everything is up and running you should really consider signing up. What can it hurt?
</p><br />

<p class="small_quip">...it really <em>can't</em>.</p>
